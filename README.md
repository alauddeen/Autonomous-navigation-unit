# Speech-Controlled Robot

## Project Overview
This project showcases a unique robot, engineered to respond to voice commands without using traditional speech recognition modules. It uses a graphical programming language and is controlled via a custom-developed Human Machine Interface (HMI) created in LabView. The robot's backend and speech control API are built using .NET, enabling long-range control through various communication protocols.

## Features
- Voice command recognition developed with LabView and .NET.
- Long-range control capabilities over multiple communication protocols.
- Graphical programming language for enhanced functionality.
- No requirement of speech controlled modules. Uses systems inbuilt microphone.

## Installation and Setup
Instructions on setting up the LabView environment and integrating the .NET-based speech control API.
